      <h1>Windows Security Basics</h1>
      <p>This page covers the fundamental concepts of Windows security. Understanding these basics is the first step towards a more secure computing environment.</p>

      <h2>User Accounts</h2>
      <p>User accounts are essential for security. They ensure that only authorized individuals can access your computer and control what they can do. Windows has different types of user accounts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Administrator Accounts:</strong> These accounts have full control over the system. They can install software, change system settings, and access all files. It's best practice to use an administrator account only when necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard User Accounts:</strong> These accounts have limited privileges. They can run applications and manage their own files, but cannot make system-wide changes or install most software without administrator approval. Using a standard account for daily tasks is recommended for better security.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>User Account Control (UAC)</strong> is a security feature that helps prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. When an action requires administrative privileges, UAC prompts for confirmation or an administrator password, giving you a chance to review the change before it's made.</p>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <p>File and folder permissions, often referred to as NTFS permissions (for the New Technology File System used by Windows), control who can access specific files and folders and what they can do with them (e.g., read, write, modify, delete). Permissions are a critical layer of security that helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or modification, even by other users on the same computer.</p>
      <p>By setting appropriate permissions, you can ensure that users only have access to the information they need, adhering to the principle of least privilege.</p>

      <h2>Windows Update</h2>
      <p>Keeping your Windows operating system updated is one of the most important security practices. Windows Update delivers regular updates that include security patches, bug fixes, and new features. Security patches are crucial as they fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware or hackers to gain unauthorized access to your system or data. Always ensure Windows Update is enabled and configured to install updates automatically.</p>

      <h2>Windows Security App</h2>
      <p>Windows comes with a built-in comprehensive security application called <strong>Windows Security</strong> (formerly known as Windows Defender Security Center). It provides a centralized dashboard to manage various security features. Key components include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Virus & threat protection:</strong> Real-time protection against malware, viruses, ransomware, and other threats. It also allows you to run scans.</li>
        <li><strong>Firewall & network protection:</strong> Manages the Windows Defender Firewall, which helps protect your device from unauthorized network traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>App & browser control:</strong> Helps protect against potentially unwanted apps, files, malicious sites, and downloads.</li>
        <li><strong>Device security:</strong> Provides access to built-in hardware security features.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regularly checking the Windows Security app ensures your device's protection status is green and all features are functioning correctly.</p>
