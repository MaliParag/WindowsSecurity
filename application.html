          <h3>App control policies</h3>
          <p><strong>AppLocker</strong> is a feature in Windows that helps administrators control which applications and files users can run on a system. By creating rules based on file attributes like publisher, product name, file name, or file hash, AppLocker can prevent unwanted or unauthorized software from executing. This is a powerful tool in preventing malware infections (as many malicious programs will be blocked from running) and ensuring that only approved applications are used within an organization, thereby enhancing overall system security and compliance.</p>
          <p>AppLocker rules can be configured for different users and groups, providing granular control over application usage.</p>
