      <h1>Operating System Security</h1>

      <h2>Encryption and data protection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>BitLocker</h3>
          <p><strong>BitLocker Drive Encryption</strong> is a full-disk encryption feature included with certain versions of Windows. Its primary purpose is to protect your data by encrypting the entire operating system drive (and optionally other fixed data drives). If a device protected by BitLocker is lost or stolen, the data on the drive remains encrypted and inaccessible without the correct decryption key, recovery password, or startup key. This is especially crucial for protecting sensitive information on laptops and other portable devices.</p>
          <p>BitLocker can use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip for enhanced security by storing encryption keys, or it can work with a USB startup key or a password for systems without a compatible TPM.</p>

          <h3>Windows Firewall</h3>
          <p>The <strong>Windows Defender Firewall</strong> (often just called Windows Firewall) is a built-in stateful firewall that helps protect your system from network-based threats by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic. It acts as a barrier between your computer and the internet or other networks. You can configure firewall rules to allow or block specific types of traffic based on program, port, or IP address. These rules can be defined for different network profiles: Domain Profile (when connected to a corporate domain), Private Profile (for trusted private networks), and Public Profile (for untrusted public networks, typically with the most restrictive settings). Properly configuring inbound and outbound rules is crucial for maintaining a strong network defense. The Windows Security app provides a dashboard to manage Firewall & network protection.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</h3>
          <p>Microsoft Defender Antivirus provides real-time protection against malware, viruses, ransomware, and other threats. It is a key component of Windows Security and includes features for running scans to detect and remove malicious software. This is part of the broader <strong>Virus & threat protection</strong> managed within the Windows Security app.</p>
